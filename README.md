# bcn_kobe_2019

This repo is for the data visualization output for the [World Data Viz Challenge 2018 Barcelona-Kobe](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en/data-viz-kobe-2019). The data processing can be found in this [other repo](https://github.com/borbota/bcn_kobe_dataviz).

This dashboard's aim is to show some resources that make a difference when it comes to live in a different district of a city with a special focus on the environment. The objective of the visualization was to plot these metrics in two ways: in total numbers and also in relative numbers to the population, converted to per 1000 inhabitants for each district. The perceiver of the dashboard can considers which district to live in, which best suits here needs based on the metrics on the dashboard. Nevertheless, when we will be over the tipping point and the collapse is inevitable, all this will not matter much. This dark message is reflected by the dark mode of the site.

The color scheme is based on the artwork of [Ebtisam Abdulaziz: Untitled (2014)](https://www.artistebtisamaziz.com/2014.html), as a symbol of human creativity suggesting hope.
