<h3>Barcelona â€“ people and resources</h3>
<div class="breaking">Barcelona is a metropolis, which has to serve its ~1.6 million inhabitants and millions of tourists. If we think about climate change in such a city, what do we think of? Are there parks to provide shelter on the hot summer days? Is water available for everyone? Are there cars polluting in the neighborhood? Are there many tourists increasing the abuse of the land? In the charts below, you can check these resources per 1000 inhabitants by district on the map to the left, while on the right, you can seee the total number of these sources by district.<br><br>For everything else, please learn more about <a href="https://jembendell.com/">Deep Adaptation</a>.</p></div>
