<h3>Barcelona â€“ people and resources</h3>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word">Barcelona is a busy city, which needs abundant resources to serve its ~1.6 million inhabitants and millions of tourists, some of them staying in Airbnbs all around the city. Which district is the best to live in according to your standards? Do you prefer a district, where there are many fountains on the streets, where youcan fill up your bottle? Do you want to live in a district, with many parks? Or for you the vehicles are important? The map indicates the number of these assets by 1000 inhabitants by each district, while the charts on the left indicate the absolute number of these assets by each district.</p>
